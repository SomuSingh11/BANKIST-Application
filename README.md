## 🛠️Features

- **Responsive UI:** Built using HTML and vanilla CSS to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Date and Currency Formatting**: Utilizes JavaScript's Intl.DateTimeFormat and Intl.NumberFormat for internationalizing dates and currencies.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Implements dynamic DOM manipulation to update the UI in real-time based on user actions.
- **Safety Feature:** Includes a logout timer that logs users out after a period of inactivity.

##  ⚙️Functionality

The Bankist application **simulates a simplified online banking system**. 

It allows users to:

- **Log in** securely using their username and PIN.
